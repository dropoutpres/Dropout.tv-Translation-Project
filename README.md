# Dropout.tv Translation Project

<i>This repo is still under construction.</i>

==============================

Currently, [Dropout.tv](https://www.dropout.tv/)'s shows and programs have been primarily produced and released in English, limiting their accessibility to non-English speaking audiences. Taking inspiration from similar projects, such as [Firewatch Community Localization](https://github.com/camposantogames/firewatch_localization) and the [Taskmaster Translation Project](https://linktr.ee/tmworldwideinc), we've created a repository of Dropout program subtitles for fans to translate. Translators can access the full SubRip (`.srt`) file database and contribute their translations back to the community for others to use.

The only professional captions are available in English, but with the help of multilingual fans, hopefully we can make Dropout, and by extension, CollegeHumor's content more accessible to a wider audience. The repository will update as new translations become available, so be sure to check back often.

While it is recommended to use specialized software like [Subtitle Edit](https://www.nikse.dk/subtitleedit), if you plan to use basic text editors, please note that Microsoft Notepad has limited support for characters outside of the ISO Latin-1 character set, such as characters used in non-Western languages. To avoid issues with character display or encoding, it is recommended to use an alternative, such as [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/), that offers more robust support for a wider range of character encodings, including Unicode.

Where to find the data
-----------
On the Github page, under the `en-us` folder, youâ€™ll find complete SubRip files for various released programs, titled `Name - Season #, Episode # - Episode Title` with a language modifier, the US English one being `.en-us`. You can download the entire repository as a `.zip` file through Github.

The `.zip` file contains all the programs, as well as any other languages that are uploaded, and this README. If you're serious about doing a full language translation, we recommend making a Github account and learning how to [pull down a git repo](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/).
